# 🗒Expansion Notes

## Limited Edition Alpha (LEA)
- [Balance] and its ilk do not contribute to anyone's fun and have no place in my stack.
- [Mana Short] - would effectively say 'target player cannot play any more spells this turn', but only really works with people ganging up.
- [Timetwister] | [Wheel of Fortune] - One spell per turn makes these sorts of effects really rough.
## Arabian Nights (ARN)
- [Dandan] - A great format and the idea of multiple people having the same shared library has been around a long time.
- [Aladdin's Ring] ➕ aka The Shotgun - the first card chronologically that makes the stack. It has been part of mine since the very first iteration (made only out of bulk rares). Unique effect.
## Antiquities (ATQ)
- [Strip Mine] - Arguably could be in the deck, but so could [Wasteland] et all. There are so few lands I intentionally want them to be difficult to deal with.
## Legends (LEG)
- [Recall] - Never underestimate the need for simpler versions of effects.
- [Chains of Mephistopheles] - See above
- [Greed] - What is the cost for a card? One shot `target player draws X cards` effects can be redirected, countered, fought over. Paying life to draw cards should also be a one-shot, plus some other additional side-effect. This is just too powerful.
- [Storm World] - In a draft stack this might be an interesting effect, a global [The Rack], but in a shared stack it just punishes people.
- [Storm Seeker] -> [Gaze of Adamaro] -> [Runeflare Trap] (w/Trap Rule)
- [Nicol Bolas] - The best of the 'legends', remembering the upkeep and causing players to go into topdeck mode make this unfun.
- [Karakas] - Shared stack means this is randomly useful and mostly unfun.
## The Dark (DRK)
- [Amnesia] - These effects are unfun in shared stack, forcing a player into topdecking.
- [Inferno] ➕ I have liked this card. It speeds up the game, finishes off weak players, instant speed, also helps with board clear. Unique effect.
- [Maze of Ith] ➕ Can be used defensively, offensively (pseudo-vigilance), and politically. A strong include, but not unshakeable.
## Fallen Empires (FEM)
- [Combat Medic] ➕ Legit include and unique effect, this can be used politically.
## Ice Age (ICE)
- [Brainstorm] - Deserves a mention here because of the shared stack. There are better effects now, but also this sort of effect needs to have much more of an impact. Draw 2 is the absolute minimum and that has to have a large side effect to even be worth it.
- [Zur's Weirding] - Leads to very unfun gamestates.
- [Necropotence] - See [Greed], these effect must be limited.
- [Jokulhaups] - Unless the spell removes all non-land perms, it must have a significant upside.
- [Pyroblast] - This has been in previous stacks, but at this point any counterspell must have upsides, not downsides.
- [Essence Vortex] ➕ For ages I have included 'choice' cards in the stack, as a way to encourage more player engagement. This one still squeaks in as an instant and life loss.
## Homelands (HML)
- [Memory Lapse] ➕Shared stack this is a fun effect (see [Dandan])
## Alliances (ALL)
- [Force of Will] ➕Instant include, the granddaddy of all free counterspells.
- [Balduvian Dead] - An interesting effect to swarm attack an opponent, this is too close to a one-turn-kill.
- [Misinformation] - Never in my original stacks, this caught my eye for variant [Dandan] lists. Fairly unique effect, but it can't quite be abused enough with the one-spell-per-turn limit to include.
## Mirage (MIR)
- [Mist Dragon] ➕ Beloved dragon, nearly impossible to kill, in a quantum state of flying/not-flying, it barely makes the initial pass.
- [Spirit of the Night] ➕ The first considerable heavy, SotN's trifecta of `flying trample haste` still has few contenders. Makes the first cut.
- [Illicit Auction] - I love bidding cards, but sorcery speed kills this.
- [Reflect Damage] ➕ Does not target _anything_.
## Visions (VIS)
- [Desertion] ➕Counter spell, just get an artifact or creature, very solid.
- [Three Wishes] - A targeted draw three is more interesting.
- [City of Solitude] - Maybe okay for a draft stack, miserable in shared.
- [Natural Order] - This could almost make it in a draft stack. Almost.
## Weatherlight (WTH)
- [Thran Tome] - Interesting repeated card draw. Draw the 2nd and 3rd best of 3 is neat, but maybe not worth an entire slot? 👁
## Tempest (TMP)
- `Buyback` ❤️
- [Invulnerability] ➕ Repeatable, non-targeted damage prevention, never had it in before but maybe this is interesting.
- [Worthy Cause] - Repeatable life gain, however, is not a great idea, it drags games out.
- [Capsize] ➕Everyone hates it, no one loves it, and yet it goes first during drafts.
- [Dismiss] - It's time has come and gone. There are dozens and dozens of strictly better counterspells, no matter how much my Arena Promo begs to be included.
- [Ertai's Meddling] - This 'counters' uncounterable spells, but the trickery of infinite / non X's makes this hard to include. I had a version before that did it for d10 turns, but I don't want to include custom or edited cards in this stack.
- [Intuition] ▶ Draft stack auto-include.
- [Time Warp] - +1 turn is barely an [Explore] in this format, the only extra turn effects that will ever make it are more than one additional turn or instant speed.
- [Whispers of the Muse] ➕*busted*
- [Corpse Dance] ➕The only reason for `graveyard matter orders` is this nightmare of a card.
- [Searing Touch] ➕The Bad Touch, no one ever cares to counter it until after it has done devious things.
- [Verdant Force] - Has been since eclipsed.
## Stronghold (STH)
- [Dream Halls] - Is hilarious and someone always has the nuts and just wins.
- [Evacuation] - In a draft stack this sort of effect is solid, but so many creatures have etb effects now that it becomes a liability.
- [Mind Games] - Never tried in a previous stack, this is an interesting effect, but plausibly too annoying.
- [Lab Rats] - See [Sprout Swarm] 
## Exodus (EXO)
- [Allay] - This and [Shattering Pulse] contribute to bad game states. Destroy effects need to be one-shots.
- [Ertai, Wizard Adept] - In the original stack, this creature is too small and the effect too slow to still include.
- [Forbid] ➕ Here we go! The downside is just enough that this doesn't become oppressive.
- [Hatred] - Extremely risk/reward, this usually involved killing at least one player or the caster getting it countered and then beat. I can see this in some stacks.
- [Necrologia] - Risk/Reward again, and the tricky timing.
- [Slaughter] - Laughter aside, I've included and removed this card a few times. Repeatable creature kill is annoying, but the 4 life and non-black clauses limit the damage. In the end, there are more interesting kill spells.
- [Survival of the Fittest] ▶ So very insanely good in draft stack!
## Unglued (UGL)
- Of course I would include UN-cards in my stack.
- [Infernal Spawn of Evil] - It is coming...
## Urza's Saga (USG)
- `Cycling` shows up here, an ability that adds value to any card in the stack.
- [Humble] - itself power crept out, the effect saw play in a prior stack in [Snakeform]
- [Morphling] - in a prior stack, a `5/♾, flying, vigilance, shroud` was a pretty great creature, but having to deal with the abilities and general stats, this has been outclassed.
- [Sneak Attack] ➕If this is not instantly countered, it might be a player's death. Or maybe not, this card slips in based up on being iconic.
- [Abundance] - lets you draw the lands in the deck.
- [Fluctuator] - I love this card. That's all.
- [Phyrexian Processor] - In a previous stack, outclassed.
- [Temporal Aperture] ➕ Random free spell. I love random.

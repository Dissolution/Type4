# üóíExpansion Notes

## Limited Edition Alpha (LEA)
- [Balance] and its ilk do not contribute to anyone's fun and have no place in my stack.
- [Mana Short] - would effectively say 'target player cannot play any more spells this turn', but only really works with people ganging up.
- [Timetwister] | [Wheel of Fortune] - One spell per turn makes these sorts of effects really rough.
## Arabian Nights (ARN)
- [Dandan] - A great format and the idea of multiple people having the same shared library has been around a long time.
- [Aladdin's Ring] ‚ûï aka The Shotgun - the first card chronologically that makes the stack. It has been part of mine since the very first iteration (made only out of bulk rares). Unique effect.
## Antiquities (ATQ)
- [Strip Mine] - Arguably could be in the deck, but so could [Wasteland] et all. There are so few lands I intentionally want them to be difficult to deal with.
## Legends (LEG)
- [Recall] - Never underestimate the need for simpler versions of effects.
- [Chains of Mephistopheles] - See above
- [Greed] - What is the cost for a card? One shot `target player draws X cards` effects can be redirected, countered, fought over. Paying life to draw cards should also be a one-shot, plus some other additional side-effect. This is just too powerful.
- [Storm World] - In a draft stack this might be an interesting effect, a global [The Rack], but in a shared stack it just punishes people.
- [Storm Seeker] -> [Gaze of Adamaro] -> [Runeflare Trap] (w/Trap Rule)
- [Nicol Bolas] - The best of the 'legends', remembering the upkeep and causing players to go into topdeck mode make this unfun.
- [Karakas] - Shared stack means this is randomly useful and mostly unfun.
## The Dark (DRK)
- [Amnesia] - These effects are unfun in shared stack, forcing a player into topdecking.
- [Inferno] ‚ûï I have liked this card. It speeds up the game, finishes off weak players, instant speed, also helps with board clear. Unique effect.
- [Maze of Ith] ‚ûï Can be used defensively, offensively (pseudo-vigilance), and politically. A strong include, but not unshakeable.
## Fallen Empires (FEM)
- [Combat Medic] ‚ûï Legit include and unique effect, this can be used politically.
## Ice Age (ICE)
- [Brainstorm] - Deserves a mention here because of the shared stack. There are better effects now, but also this sort of effect needs to have much more of an impact. Draw 2 is the absolute minimum and that has to have a large side effect to even be worth it.
- [Zur's Weirding] - Leads to very unfun gamestates.
- [Necropotence] - See [Greed], these effect must be limited.
- [Jokulhaups] - Unless the spell removes all non-land perms, it must have a significant upside.
- [Pyroblast] - This has been in previous stacks, but at this point any counterspell must have upsides, not downsides.
- [Essence Vortex] ‚ûï For ages I have included 'choice' cards in the stack, as a way to encourage more player engagement. This one still squeaks in as an instant and life loss.
## Homelands (HML)
- [Memory Lapse] ‚ûïShared stack this is a fun effect (see [Dandan])
## Alliances (ALL)
- [Force of Will] ‚ûïInstant include, the granddaddy of all free counterspells.
- [Balduvian Dead] - An interesting effect to swarm attack an opponent, this is too close to a one-turn-kill.
- [Misinformation] - Never in my original stacks, this caught my eye for variant [Dandan] lists. Fairly unique effect, but it can't quite be abused enough with the one-spell-per-turn limit to include.
## Mirage (MIR)
- [Mist Dragon] ‚ûï Beloved dragon, nearly impossible to kill, in a quantum state of flying/not-flying, it barely makes the initial pass.
- [Spirit of the Night] ‚ûï The first considerable heavy, SotN's trifecta of `flying trample haste` still has few contenders. Makes the first cut.
- [Illicit Auction] - I love bidding cards, but sorcery speed kills this.
- [Reflect Damage] ‚ûï Does not target _anything_.
## Visions (VIS)
- [Desertion] ‚ûïCounter spell, just get an artifact or creature, very solid.
- [Three Wishes] - A targeted draw three is more interesting.
- [City of Solitude] - Maybe okay for a draft stack, miserable in shared.
- [Natural Order] - This could almost make it in a draft stack. Almost.
## Weatherlight (WTH)
- [Thran Tome] - Interesting repeated card draw. Draw the 2nd and 3rd best of 3 is neat, but maybe not worth an entire slot? üëÅ
## Tempest (TMP)
- `Buyback` ‚ù§Ô∏è
- [Invulnerability] ‚ûï Repeatable, non-targeted damage prevention, never had it in before but maybe this is interesting.
- [Worthy Cause] - Repeatable life gain, however, is not a great idea, it drags games out.
- [Capsize] ‚ûïEveryone hates it, no one loves it, and yet it goes first during drafts.
- [Dismiss] - It's time has come and gone. There are dozens and dozens of strictly better counterspells, no matter how much my Arena Promo begs to be included.
- [Ertai's Meddling] - This 'counters' uncounterable spells, but the trickery of infinite / non X's makes this hard to include. I had a version before that did it for d10 turns, but I don't want to include custom or edited cards in this stack.
- [Intuition] ‚ñ∂ Draft stack auto-include.
- [Time Warp] - +1 turn is barely an [Explore] in this format, the only extra turn effects that will ever make it are more than one additional turn or instant speed.
- [Whispers of the Muse] ‚ûï*busted*
- [Corpse Dance] ‚ûïThe only reason for `graveyard matter orders` is this nightmare of a card.
- [Searing Touch] ‚ûïThe Bad Touch, no one ever cares to counter it until after it has done devious things.
- [Verdant Force] - Has been since eclipsed.
## Stronghold (STH)
- [Dream Halls] - Is hilarious and someone always has the nuts and just wins.
- [Evacuation] - In a draft stack this sort of effect is solid, but so many creatures have etb effects now that it becomes a liability.
- [Mind Games] - Never tried in a previous stack, this is an interesting effect, but plausibly too annoying.
- [Lab Rats] - See [Sprout Swarm] 
## Exodus (EXO)
- [Allay] - This and [Shattering Pulse] contribute to bad game states. Destroy effects need to be one-shots.
- [Ertai, Wizard Adept] - In the original stack, this creature is too small and the effect too slow to still include.
- [Forbid] ‚ûï Here we go! The downside is just enough that this doesn't become oppressive.
- [Hatred] - Extremely risk/reward, this usually involved killing at least one player or the caster getting it countered and then beat. I can see this in some stacks.
- [Necrologia] - Risk/Reward again, and the tricky timing.
- [Slaughter] - Laughter aside, I've included and removed this card a few times. Repeatable creature kill is annoying, but the 4 life and non-black clauses limit the damage. In the end, there are more interesting kill spells.
- [Survival of the Fittest] ‚ñ∂ So very insanely good in draft stack!
## Unglued (UGL)
- Of course I would include UN-cards in my stack.
- [Infernal Spawn of Evil] - It is coming...
## Urza's Saga (USG)
- `Cycling` shows up here, an ability that adds value to any card in the stack.
- [Humble] - itself power crept out, the effect saw play in a prior stack in [Snakeform]
- [Morphling] - in a prior stack, a `5/‚ôæ, flying, vigilance, shroud` was a pretty great creature, but having to deal with the abilities and general stats, this has been outclassed.
- [Sneak Attack] ‚ûïIf this is not instantly countered, it might be a player's death. Or maybe not, this card slips in based up on being iconic.
- [Abundance] - lets you draw the lands in the deck.
- [Fluctuator] - I love this card. That's all.
- [Phyrexian Processor] - In a previous stack, outclassed.
- [Temporal Aperture] ‚ûï Random free spell. I love random.
## Urza's Legacy (ULG)
- [Opportunity] ‚ûïThis is the only instant speed, targeted, draw 4+ card every printed, truly amazing in the stack.
- [Tinker] - This seems playable in draft stack, but there are more powerful cards that can put into play without needing an existing artifact.
- [Defense of the Heart] - Playable in draft stack, this feels like it might be too difficult to trigger and it has to stick around.
- [Multani, Maro-Sorcerer] ‚ûïMakes the first cut, a massive (but variable) body with shroud is still efficient.
- [Quicksilver Amulet] - There are many variations of this effect, [Sneak Attack] lets you put in many creatures with haste, but they die at end of turn. [Timmy, Power Gamer] lets you put any number into play at once. I think there is a limited amount of room for this effect.
## Portal Three Kingdoms (PTK)
- [Overwhelming Forces] ‚ûïIt only hits one player, but being able to devastate a player with a dozen saprolings while drawing that many cards is worth a sorcery.
## Urza's Destiny (UDS)
- [Academy Rector] - If a creature has a particularly nasty dies/leaves trigger, it needs to be large enough that killing it is an actual decision.
- [Masticore] - This and other `*core` creatures, while interesting in their effects, are harshly evaluated and most people don't like playing with them.
## Mercadian Masques (MMQ)
- [Bribery] ‚ñ∂ Insane include in draft stack.
- [Misdirection] ‚ûï Another free counterspell (you can often redirect the original spell to point to Misdirection)
- [Forced March] - Used to be in the stack, the ability to ignore certain creatures was useful, but there are more interesting sweepers now.
- [Thieves' Auction] - I love bidding/random/chaotic effects for the stack, they can lead to some great memories. This card is very, very swingy, but the caster does get first choice.
- [Panacea] - Would you believe there was a time when this card made the stack?
## Nemesis (NEM)
- [Dominate] ‚ûïWhile [Blue Sun's Twilight] has an additional effect, this is an instant!
## Prophecy (PCY)
- [Plague Wind] - Sadly surpassed by [In Garruk's Wake]
- [Searing Wind] ‚ûïThis is what burn looks like. 10 damage, any target, instant.
- [Vitalizing Wind] - Deserves a mention for what is both overpowered and very weak at the same time.
## Invasion (INV)
- Every ability is just `kicker`.
- [Dismantling Blow] ‚ûïA long favorite absolutely returns.
- [Reya Dawnbringer] - Reanimation each upkeep will be revisited in scarier form [Sheoldred, Whispering One]
- [Rout] - Also revisited with [Fated Retribution] and/or [Final Showdown]
- [Empress Galina] - Was so very good in the first iteration of the stack. Now? Laughable. How power has crept.
- [Fact or Fiction] ‚ûïEOTFOFYL
- [Agonizing Demise] ‚ûïFun removal and looks great in foil!
- [Yawgmoth's Agenda] ‚ûïZero downside, lets you use your entire graveyard as as second hand, this is iconic for Type 4.
- [Mages' Contest] ‚ûï Finally, a bidding card makes it in. Instant sped and head games!
- [Obliterate] ‚ûï Has been in every previous incarnation of the stack. Uncounterability and hitting lands pushes this into the first draft.
- [Urza's Rage] ‚ûï10 uncounterable, unpreventable damage to any target is üî•.
- [Restock] - Used to be a solid inclusion, has been surpassed.
- [Thicket Elemental] ‚ûïHas always made the stack. A 4/4 is pathetic, but the uncounterable unknown other creature is fun chaos.
- [Absorb] + [Undermine] - used to be among the best counterspells; now they barely rate a mention compared to [Punish Ignorance].
- [Armored Guardian] - On the fence about this on, there are some tricky instances about the order of granting protection and the constant 'every time I have priority, all creatures gain protection' spiel.
- [Artifact Mutation] + [Aura Mutation] - Also on the fence. Single shot, create potentially a bunch of tokens. üëÅ
- [Cauldron Dance] ‚ûïTricky timing aside, this is a crazy card, especially now that so many creatures have etb abilities.
- [Recoil] - Great artist. The card is a fairly unique effect, being instant and able to hit lands. Unsure if it has enough power. üëÅ
- [Reviving Vapors] - This was a solid inclusion, but at +0 card advantage and just some life gain, this is iffy. üëÅ
- [Spinal Embrace] ‚ûïThis is just the right type of threaten effect, and its not even red!
- [Tsabo Tavoc] - I built my first stack from a pile of bulk rares l had laying around. I distinctly remember this card doing serious work. Back in the day...
- [Planar Portal] ‚ñ∂ Tap, [Demonic Tutor]? Yes please.
## Planeshift (PLS)
- [Orim's Chant] - Don't do this. Yes, upkeep [Time Stop] is funny, but that card has many other clever uses. This only exists to deny a player a turn.
- [Crosis's Charm] ‚ûï There are very few 3-mode charms where every mode is decent in Type 4, this is one of them.
- [Eladamri's Call] ‚ñ∂ Yes, I will eot fetch [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir] and then win the game, thanks!
## Apocalypse (APC)
- [Bloodfire Colossus] ‚ûïIf [Inferno] is good, then the same thing as a creature is better!
- [Captain's Maneuver] ‚ûïNo, _you_ die.
- [Mystic Snake] - Mistake snake! üêç I love this card, it has been outclassed. üò¢
- [Prophetic Bolt] ‚ûïDamage and slight card advantage, slips in.
- [Legacy Weapon] ‚ûï Sometimes, you need to exile the world colorlessly. Just don't forget to exile this with its own ability before it goes.
## Odyssey (ODY)
- [Ray of Distortion] - While this sits in the graveyard, no one casts artifacts nor enchantments.
- [Fervent Denial] ‚ûïThis, however, sits in the graveyard and someone has to eat the bullet, leading to great politics.
- [Shifty Doppelganger] - Funny how, in all my years of playing and looking, I never once noticed this card for the stack. üëÅ
- [Time Stretch] ‚ûïTwo extra turns is our minimum, and this is targeted, which leads to fun!
- [Mindslicer] - Not anymore. This was always unfun.
- [Skeletal Scrying] - In the late game, this exceeds the limit of how good card draw can be.
- [Molten Influence] - This is an earlier incarnation of [Dash Hopes]. 4 damage isn't enough.
- [Holistic Wisdom] ‚ûïThis card seems weak on first glance, but it is a massive engine in the later game.
- [Iridescent Angel] - Used to be a solid creature in the stack, but with the creature 'creep that has been going on, this is only worth the mention.
- [Mirari] ‚ûï A reason to tap out, being able to copy all future instants and sorceries is worth the risk.
## Torment (TOR)
- [Plagiarize] - A similar effect exists in [Hullbreacher] and [Notion Thief], both of which effect all opponents.
- [Chainer, Dementia Master] ‚ûïRestricted reanimation, no haste (so it doesn't insta-kill), and if it dies everything gets exiled, preventing re-abuse.
- [Hypnox] - This was in several early versions of the stack. There are some tricks you can play with the triggers, but it still falls into the category of unfun.
- [Overmaster] - Oh, how I wish this effect worked in the stack. I have seen some variant stacks that errata this type of effect to not cost your spell per turn, but I don't want to go down that route in this rebuild.
- [Radiate] ‚ûïYes, pure chaos!
## Judgment (JUD)
- [Glory] ‚ûï Against my initial judgement (hehe), I'm going to keep this card in. A 3/3 flyer is not a threat, but once it is in the graveyard it is a nightmare and a dream.
- [Grip of Amnesia] - I've gone back and forth on this card many times. It is not a consistent counter, nor consistent grave hate, but it does replace itself and the foil is nice looking. Didn't make it.
- [Spelljack] ‚ûï üåü, S-tier counterspell.
- [Ember Shot] - This was the best version of this effect for a long while. Now we get insanity like [Jeskai Revelation].
- [Crush of Wurms] ‚ûï ü™±ü™±ü™±
- [Genesis] - Used to be A-tier. ü™¶, indeed.
## Onslaught (ONS)
- `Morph` - A huge subtheme of almost every previous stack has been morph, to the point that I ran [Scornful Egoist] and people would rate it highly in draft. 
- [Akroma's Vengeance] - This effect has been surpassed, even `cycling` cannot save it.
- [Crowd Favorites] - Infinite toughness, politics games with people promising to attack someone else if you let their creature stay untapped, then attacking you. I love this creature and I hope it can find space. üëÅ
- [Exalted Angel] - The **OG**, all the morph creatures in the stack need to have more of an immediate impact than a 4/4 flying lifelink.
- [Glarecaster] ‚ûï Makes the first cut, this leads to very interesting board states.
- [Arcanis the Omnipotent] - My boy has been replaced by, of all things, [Loot, the Pathfinder]. Arcy having to survive a full round meant he never lived up to his promise.
- [Blatant Thievery] - Time has come and gone.
- [Voidmage Prodigy] ‚ûï There are a lot of wizards in the stack, so this becomes a huge blowout.
- [False Cure] is cute and tempting.
- [Undead Gladiator] - Juice isn't worth the squeeze.
- [Erratic Explosion] - Wait for it...
- [Insurrection] ‚ûï Here we go! This might win the game, but someone has to.
- [Kaboom!] ‚ûï... and here it is. This hits every other player, every planeswalker (that you want), and random each time. Spin the wheel!
- [Starstorm] - See [Akroma's Vengeance]
## Legions (LGN)
- [Akroma, Angel of Wrath] ‚ûïNever outclassed, the queen bitch is awesome.
- [Chromeshell Crab] ‚ûïMine!
- [Voidmage Apprentice] ‚ûïLearns a lot from their master.
- [Willbender] ‚ûïYet another surprise!
- [Bane of the Living] ‚ûïSurprise, everything is dead++!
- [Phage the Untouchable] - Finally outclassed by [Summon: Primal Odin].
- [Skinthinner] ‚ûïPart of the `morph` support.
- [Krosan Cloudscraper] - This highly depends on the `morph` support in the rest of the stack, as a 13/13 'vanilla', this is pathetic. üëÅ
- [Nantuko Vigilante] - Just like the above, this highly depends on `morph` support. üëÅ
## Scourge (SCG)
- Type 4 is the only format where `Storm` is a bad keyword.
- [Decree of Silence] ‚ûïA free counterspell that draws a card! ‚≠ê
- [Mischievous Quanar] - Was in an earlier build until we realized this let you copy a spell infinite times.
- [Rush of Knowledge] - Once okay, now too weak + conditional.
- [Scornful Egotist] - With enough `morph` support, this is a hilarious lightning rod. üëÅ
- [Decree of Pain] ‚ûïBoth modes are spicy!
- [Unspeakable Symbol] - Good rate, no one would want to play it.
- [Decree of Annihilation] - If this didn't exile hands it might be considered, but the cycle ability barely effects Type 4.
- [Graip of Chaos] - Haha, no.
- [Decree of Savagery] - As usual, the green one sucks.
- [Hunting Pack] - The one possible exception to the storm rule, you can usually piggyback to get 3 4/4s at instant speed. But is that enough?
- [Root Elemental] ‚ûï Morph support aside, a free creature at sub-instant speed is a great effect.
# Mirrodin (MRD)
- Suddenly, the borders suck.
- [Quicksilver Elemental] - Used to be run, but it was too conditional.
- [Promise of Power] ‚ûïDraw 5, lose 5, get a 5+/5+ flying creature, this card has been in the stack and continues to find a great place.
- [Grab the Reins] ‚ûïMost of this time this is instant, destroy target creature, deal damage equal to its power to any target. And I'm okay with that.
- [Tooth and Nail] ‚ñ∂ Insta-include in draft stack.
- [Bosh, Iron Golem] - Conditional on numbers of artifacts and desire to fling them. A 6/7 trample that can throw 8 to a target isn't terrible.
- [Lightning Greaves] - I want to include some equipment, but [Swiftfoot Boots] exists.
- [Mind's Eye] ‚ûïCrazy card advantage!
- [Mindslaver] ‚ûïI absolutely love 'control target player' effects in Type 4.
- [Oblivion Stone] ‚ûï Yes.
- [Platinum Angel] - Going to miss her, surpassed _hard_ by [Herald of Eternal Dawn]
- [Sculpting Steel] - In ages past this was okay, but anything that copies now must be able to copy any permanent. 
- [Soul Foundry] ‚ûïThis effect is just fun.
- [Tower of Fortunes] ‚ûïAw shit!
## Darksteel (DST)
- [Pulse of the Fields] - All the Pulse's deserve mention, but this one is just catch-up that prolongs the game.
- [Last Word] ‚ûïAlways!
- [Pulse of the Grid] ‚ûïSpicy!
- [Pulse of the Forge] - Tested as just too weak.
- [Shunt] - A sign of beautiful things to come. These sort of effects is why I mention targeted and non-targeted.
- [Darksteel Colossus] ‚ûïBig Daddy himself sneaks into the first iteration, but his time is limited.
- [Memnarch] ‚ûï Gain control of all targetable permanents. 
- [Panoptic Mirror] ‚ûï Barely makes it in because [Soul Foundry] did, but this is slower. Tip: wait until the opponent before you's endstep to use the imprint.
- [Sword of X and Y] - Equipment must grant haste or have flash to be viable.
## Fifth Dawn (5DN)
- [Beacon of Immortality] - I have always loved the beacon cycle. This one might be worth considering, but lifegain can drag games out.
- [Acquire] ‚ñ∂ [Bribery]'s cousin.
- [Hoverguard Sweepers] - I loved this card, now it's not big enough and bounce is mostly a liability.
- [Beacon of Unrest] ‚ûï Oh yes, there are artifacts in the stack!
- Bringers - At one time, almost all of these were playable.
- [Reversal of Fortune] - üëÄreplaced with creature [Mindclaw Shaman]
- [All Suns' Dawn] ‚ûïReturn up to 5 cards is great rate and leads to interesting decisions.
- [Door to Nothingness] ‚ûïSex doesn't even compare.
- [Vedalken Orrery] ‚ûïThis effect is arguably the most powerful in the entire stack.
## Champions of Kamigawa (CHK)
- [Eight-and-a-Half-Tails] ‚ûïStack tricks galore!
- [Time Stop] ‚ûïI know that there are others, and they are likely in the stack as well.
- [Kokusho, the Evening Star] ‚ûïSo many things to say. Kills multiple players, can often get into stack wars, great killer.
- [Night Dealings] ‚ñ∂ This seems insane in draft stack, need to try it.
- [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker] ‚ûï So many degenerate plays, kill on sight.
- [Soulblast] - This was in a previous stack, but it was too conditional.
- [Through the Breach] - Limited compared to other options.
- [Boseiju, Who Shelters All] - Has been surpassed.
- [Hall of the Bandit Lord] - Has been surpassed.
## Unhinged (UNH)
-

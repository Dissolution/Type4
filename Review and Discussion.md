# üóíExpansion Notes

## Limited Edition Alpha (LEA)
- [Balance] and its ilk do not contribute to anyone's fun and have no place in my stack.
- [Mana Short] - would effectively say 'target player cannot play any more spells this turn', but only really works with people ganging up.
- [Timetwister] | [Wheel of Fortune] - One spell per turn makes these sorts of effects really rough.
## Arabian Nights (ARN)
- [Dandan] - A great format and the idea of multiple people having the same shared library has been around a long time.
- [Aladdin's Ring] ‚ûï aka The Shotgun - the first card chronologically that makes the stack. It has been part of mine since the very first iteration (made only out of bulk rares). Unique effect.
## Antiquities (ATQ)
- [Strip Mine] - Arguably could be in the deck, but so could [Wasteland] et all. There are so few lands I intentionally want them to be difficult to deal with.
## Legends (LEG)
- [Recall] - Never underestimate the need for simpler versions of effects.
- [Chains of Mephistopheles] - See above
- [Greed] - What is the cost for a card? One shot `target player draws X cards` effects can be redirected, countered, fought over. Paying life to draw cards should also be a one-shot, plus some other additional side-effect. This is just too powerful.
- [Storm World] - In a draft stack this might be an interesting effect, a global [The Rack], but in a shared stack it just punishes people.
- [Storm Seeker] -> [Gaze of Adamaro] -> [Runeflare Trap] (w/Trap Rule)
- [Nicol Bolas] - The best of the 'legends', remembering the upkeep and causing players to go into topdeck mode make this unfun.
- [Karakas] - Shared stack means this is randomly useful and mostly unfun.
## The Dark (DRK)
- [Amnesia] - These effects are unfun in shared stack, forcing a player into topdecking.
- [Inferno] ‚ûï I have liked this card. It speeds up the game, finishes off weak players, instant speed, also helps with board clear. Unique effect.
- [Maze of Ith] ‚ûï Can be used defensively, offensively (pseudo-vigilance), and politically. A strong include, but not unshakeable.
## Fallen Empires (FEM)
- [Combat Medic] ‚ûï Legit include and unique effect, this can be used politically.
## Ice Age (ICE)
- [Brainstorm] - Deserves a mention here because of the shared stack. There are better effects now, but also this sort of effect needs to have much more of an impact. Draw 2 is the absolute minimum and that has to have a large side effect to even be worth it.
- [Zur's Weirding] - Leads to very unfun gamestates.
- [Necropotence] - See [Greed], these effect must be limited.
- [Jokulhaups] - Unless the spell removes all non-land perms, it must have a significant upside.
- [Pyroblast] - This has been in previous stacks, but at this point any counterspell must have upsides, not downsides.
- [Essence Vortex] ‚ûï For ages I have included 'choice' cards in the stack, as a way to encourage more player engagement. This one still squeaks in as an instant and life loss.
## Homelands (HML)
- [Memory Lapse] ‚ûïShared stack this is a fun effect (see [Dandan])
## Alliances (ALL)
- [Force of Will] ‚ûïInstant include, the granddaddy of all free counterspells.
- [Balduvian Dead] - An interesting effect to swarm attack an opponent, this is too close to a one-turn-kill.
- [Misinformation] - Never in my original stacks, this caught my eye for variant [Dandan] lists. Fairly unique effect, but it can't quite be abused enough with the one-spell-per-turn limit to include.
## Mirage (MIR)
- [Mist Dragon] ‚ûï Beloved dragon, nearly impossible to kill, in a quantum state of flying/not-flying, it barely makes the initial pass.
- [Spirit of the Night] ‚ûï The first considerable heavy, SotN's trifecta of `flying trample haste` still has few contenders. Makes the first cut.
- [Illicit Auction] - I love bidding cards, but sorcery speed kills this.
- [Reflect Damage] ‚ûï Does not target _anything_.
## Visions (VIS)
- [Desertion] ‚ûïCounter spell, just get an artifact or creature, very solid.
- [Three Wishes] - A targeted draw three is more interesting.
- [City of Solitude] - Maybe okay for a draft stack, miserable in shared.
- [Natural Order] - This could almost make it in a draft stack. Almost.
## Weatherlight (WTH)
- [Thran Tome] - Interesting repeated card draw. Draw the 2nd and 3rd best of 3 is neat, but maybe not worth an entire slot? üëÅ
## Tempest (TMP)
- `Buyback` ‚ù§Ô∏è
- [Invulnerability] ‚ûï Repeatable, non-targeted damage prevention, never had it in before but maybe this is interesting.
- [Worthy Cause] - Repeatable life gain, however, is not a great idea, it drags games out.
- [Capsize] ‚ûïEveryone hates it, no one loves it, and yet it goes first during drafts.
- [Dismiss] - It's time has come and gone. There are dozens and dozens of strictly better counterspells, no matter how much my Arena Promo begs to be included.
- [Ertai's Meddling] - This 'counters' uncounterable spells, but the trickery of infinite / non X's makes this hard to include. I had a version before that did it for d10 turns, but I don't want to include custom or edited cards in this stack.
- [Intuition] ‚ñ∂ Draft stack auto-include.
- [Time Warp] - +1 turn is barely an [Explore] in this format, the only extra turn effects that will ever make it are more than one additional turn or instant speed.
- [Whispers of the Muse] ‚ûï*busted*
- [Corpse Dance] ‚ûïThe only reason for `graveyard matter orders` is this nightmare of a card.
- [Searing Touch] ‚ûïThe Bad Touch, no one ever cares to counter it until after it has done devious things.
- [Verdant Force] - Has been since eclipsed.
## Stronghold (STH)
- [Dream Halls] - Is hilarious and someone always has the nuts and just wins.
- [Evacuation] - In a draft stack this sort of effect is solid, but so many creatures have etb effects now that it becomes a liability.
- [Mind Games] - Never tried in a previous stack, this is an interesting effect, but plausibly too annoying.
- [Lab Rats] - See [Sprout Swarm] 
## Exodus (EXO)
- [Allay] - This and [Shattering Pulse] contribute to bad game states. Destroy effects need to be one-shots.
- [Ertai, Wizard Adept] - In the original stack, this creature is too small and the effect too slow to still include.
- [Forbid] ‚ûï Here we go! The downside is just enough that this doesn't become oppressive.
- [Hatred] - Extremely risk/reward, this usually involved killing at least one player or the caster getting it countered and then beat. I can see this in some stacks.
- [Necrologia] - Risk/Reward again, and the tricky timing.
- [Slaughter] - Laughter aside, I've included and removed this card a few times. Repeatable creature kill is annoying, but the 4 life and non-black clauses limit the damage. In the end, there are more interesting kill spells.
- [Survival of the Fittest] ‚ñ∂ So very insanely good in draft stack!
## Unglued (UGL)
- Of course I would include UN-cards in my stack.
- [Infernal Spawn of Evil] - It is coming...
## Urza's Saga (USG)
- `Cycling` shows up here, an ability that adds value to any card in the stack.
- [Humble] - itself power crept out, the effect saw play in a prior stack in [Snakeform]
- [Morphling] - in a prior stack, a `5/‚ôæ, flying, vigilance, shroud` was a pretty great creature, but having to deal with the abilities and general stats, this has been outclassed.
- [Sneak Attack] ‚ûïIf this is not instantly countered, it might be a player's death. Or maybe not, this card slips in based up on being iconic.
- [Abundance] - lets you draw the lands in the deck.
- [Fluctuator] - I love this card. That's all.
- [Phyrexian Processor] - In a previous stack, outclassed.
- [Temporal Aperture] ‚ûï Random free spell. I love random.
## Urza's Legacy (ULG)
- [Opportunity] ‚ûïThis is the only instant speed, targeted, draw 4+ card every printed, truly amazing in the stack.
- [Tinker] - This seems playable in draft stack, but there are more powerful cards that can put into play without needing an existing artifact.
- [Defense of the Heart] - Playable in draft stack, this feels like it might be too difficult to trigger and it has to stick around.
- [Multani, Maro-Sorcerer] ‚ûïMakes the first cut, a massive (but variable) body with shroud is still efficient.
- [Quicksilver Amulet] - There are many variations of this effect, [Sneak Attack] lets you put in many creatures with haste, but they die at end of turn. [Timmy, Power Gamer] lets you put any number into play at once. I think there is a limited amount of room for this effect.
## Portal Three Kingdoms (PTK)
- [Overwhelming Forces] ‚ûïIt only hits one player, but being able to devastate a player with a dozen saprolings while drawing that many cards is worth a sorcery.
## Urza's Destiny (UDS)
- [Academy Rector] - If a creature has a particularly nasty dies/leaves trigger, it needs to be large enough that killing it is an actual decision.
- [Masticore] - This and other `*core` creatures, while interesting in their effects, are harshly evaluated and most people don't like playing with them.
## Mercadian Masques (MMQ)
- [Bribery] ‚ñ∂ Insane include in draft stack.
- [Misdirection] ‚ûï Another free counterspell (you can often redirect the original spell to point to Misdirection)
- [Forced March] - Used to be in the stack, the ability to ignore certain creatures was useful, but there are more interesting sweepers now.
- [Thieves' Auction] - I love bidding/random/chaotic effects for the stack, they can lead to some great memories. This card is very, very swingy, but the caster does get first choice.
- [Panacea] - Would you believe there was a time when this card made the stack?
## Nemesis (NEM)
- [Dominate] ‚ûïWhile [Blue Sun's Twilight] has an additional effect, this is an instant!
## Prophecy (PCY)
- [Plague Wind] - Sadly surpassed by [In Garruk's Wake]
- [Searing Wind] ‚ûïThis is what burn looks like. 10 damage, any target, instant.
- [Vitalizing Wind] - Deserves a mention for what is both overpowered and very weak at the same time.
## Invasion (INV)
- Every ability is just `kicker`.
- [Dismantling Blow] ‚ûïA long favorite absolutely returns.
- [Reya Dawnbringer] - Reanimation each upkeep will be revisited in scarier form [Sheoldred, Whispering One]
- [Rout] - Also revisited with [Fated Retribution] and/or [Final Showdown]
- [Empress Galina] - Was so very good in the first iteration of the stack. Now? Laughable. How power has crept.
- [Fact or Fiction] ‚ûïEOTFOFYL
- [Agonizing Demise] ‚ûïFun removal and looks great in foil!

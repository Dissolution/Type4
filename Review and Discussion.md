# ðŸ—’Expansion Notes

## Limited Edition Alpha (LEA)
- [Balance] and its ilk do not contribute to anyone's fun and have no place in my stack.
- [Mana Short] - would effectively say 'target player cannot play any more spells this turn', but only really works with people ganging up.
- [Timetwister] | [Wheel of Fortune] - One spell per turn makes these sorts of effects really rough.
## Arabian Nights (ARN)
- [Dandan] - A great format and the idea of multiple people having the same shared library has been around a long time.
- [Aladdin's Ring] âž• aka The Shotgun - the first card chronologically that makes the stack. It has been part of mine since the very first iteration (made only out of bulk rares). Unique effect.
## Antiquities (ATQ)
- [Strip Mine] - Arguably could be in the deck, but so could [Wasteland] et all. There are so few lands I intentionally want them to be difficult to deal with.
## Legends (LEG)
- [Recall] - Never underestimate the need for simpler versions of effects.
- [Chains of Mephistopheles] - See above
- [Greed] - What is the cost for a card? One shot `target player draws X cards` effects can be redirected, countered, fought over. Paying life to draw cards should also be a one-shot, plus some other additional side-effect. This is just too powerful.
- [Storm World] - In a draft stack this might be an interesting effect, a global [The Rack], but in a shared stack it just punishes people.
- [Storm Seeker] -> [Gaze of Adamaro] -> [Runeflare Trap] (w/Trap Rule)
- [Nicol Bolas] - The best of the 'legends', remembering the upkeep and causing players to go into topdeck mode make this unfun.
- [Karakas] - Shared stack means this is randomly useful and mostly unfun.
## The Dark (DRK)
- [Amnesia] - These effects are unfun in shared stack, forcing a player into topdecking.
- [Inferno] âž• I have liked this card. It speeds up the game, finishes off weak players, instant speed, also helps with board clear. Unique effect.
- [Maze of Ith] âž• Can be used defensively, offensively (pseudo-vigilance), and politically. A strong include, but not unshakeable.

[Necropotence] - See [Greed], this is just too powerful.
